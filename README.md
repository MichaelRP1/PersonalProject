# 2019 IB MYP Personal Project

### Introduction
I am a student that is required to participate in the **International BaccalaureateÂ® (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP)** through my school as it is a certified **IB World School**.  Because of this, and my interest in coding, computers, and development in general, I will use this GitHub repository as a piece of proof for the Personal Project Journal entries that are required for the program.  The proof will include the following:

- Commits (Changes) with Time Stamps
- Progression Over Time
- Source Code Repository
- Maintaining SPART Goals that were set
- And More
## Personal Project Final Idea / Proposal **(Approved)**
- **Idea 4**: Make a website using primarily, or only, HTML, CSS, and PHP

Make a website, using primarily HTML 5, CSS 3, and PHP, with advanced tools in HTML and CSS, such as CSS grids, grid area and more that would make the website look better than another made with using the default header, nav, article, section, and footer tags present in HTML 5.  An instructional video for beginner to intermediate web developers would be made to present these ideas and how to use them in the developing of a website.  At this point, the target audience would be middle or high school children who would like supplements for a Computer Science Web Development course that they might be taking in school; for example, the CIW Site Development Associate or CIW Web Foundations Associate, which I also happen to have received the certifications for those courses.
