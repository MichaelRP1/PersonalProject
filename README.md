# 2019 IB MYP Personal Project

### Introduction
I am a student that is required to participate in the **International BaccalaureateÂ® (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP)** through my school as it is a certified **IB World School**.  Because of this, and my interest in coding, computers, and development in general, I will use this GitHub repository as a piece of proof for the Personal Project Journal entries that are required for the program.  The proof will include the following:

- Commits (Changes) with Time Stamps
- Progression Over Time
- Source Code Repository
- Maintaining SMART Goals that were set
- And More
## Personal Project Final Idea / Proposal **(Approved)**
- **Idea 4**: Make a website using primarily, or only, HTML, CSS, and PHP

Make a website, using primarily HTML 5, CSS 3, and PHP, with advanced tools in HTML and CSS, which I would learn through this process in the project.  The website will consist of a way for residents of PBC to find a vet for their pet, mainly a dog or cat, with the use of a databse.
